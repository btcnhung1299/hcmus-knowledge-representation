# Logic Inference

This repository contains Python implementation of Propositional resolution and First-order logic Forward Chaning. You can find pseudo code in [Russell, Stuart J. (Stuart Jonathan). Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597).

Note:
- The implementation does not guarantee chronological order in output. Please modify the code for your problem.
- We have reduced the inference time in the original Forward-chaining algorithim up to 70% by discarding facts which are irrevelant to the current rule.
